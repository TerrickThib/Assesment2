Assment 2, Translation, Rotation, Scale  

# I.Requirements  
**1.Description of Problem**

**Name:** Assment 2 

**Problem Statement:**  
Creation of a 2D or 3D application that demostrates Rotation, translation, scale and a Matrix Heiercy, Also demenstats use of AABB Colliders or Circle Coliders.  

**Problem Specifications:**     
- Shows the use of Matrix Heiercy using a parent child Relationship.  
- The game shows Rotation by having a child parented that shows rotation.
- The game also shows scale by scaling the enemy which also scales the child.   
- Shows translation by haveing both the player and the enemy move around the game area.  
- Shows a example of AABB Colision.


**2.Input Information**   
- Takes in players movement, to navigate the play area.  
- Takes in players use of projectiles, to determine if it colides with enemy.  
- Also uses players location, to have enemy follow him.  
- Also uses players Location to figure out Velocity.  

**3.Output Information**  
- Uses the information gathered to progress the game by killing the enemy or your self.  

**4.User Interface Information**  
- Displays The players sprite as well as the enemy.   

# II.Design  
1. *System Architecture*  
All Objects are in there own class which could inherete from onother class. There are child actors which are tied to there Parent actor. This Parent actor Pesutes the players Actor and will do damage if touched. The Game Engine uses a Start, Update, Draw  and EndFunction as well as a Scene class to progress through the game.
